            We may collect specific information about how customers use our product. This include situations such as how a customer uses a
            specific feature and when a customer uses the product. The information is collected as data logs, images, or a logical sequence
            of images/videos to reply an issue encountered by a user. Our logging system automatically collects information such as the
            internet protocol address, browser type, browser language, referring URL, features accessed, errors generated, time zone,
            geo-location data, operating system information, and other such information that is transmitted in the header of the userâ€™s HTTP

            We use Google APIs for achieving the following:

          <Typography.Custom className={'font-main text-[18.03px] leading-[32px]'}>
            1. Google OAuth APIs are used to perform a Single Sign On through Google, while doing so we ensure that the email provided by
            the Google Auth server is a valid user of the Yara system. <br />
            2. We use Google Drive APIs to retrieve file URLs and Ids of the files attached by the user into his/her Yara account. We also
            manage the permissions of these files through the drive APIs when the workflow on Yara attached to these files are in progress.
